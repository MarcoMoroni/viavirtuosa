          <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
        </header>
        <p>This business area requires a continuous scouting of new perimeters to be analysed. The key issue is to use standard methodologies that are repeatable (ISO, Cobit, ITIL, SOX, etc.). Providing the service at the top level requires a mix of cyber security skills that hardly can be found in a single vendor. One of the basic security principles is to ensure the rotation of specialised auditors that perform the analysis. We prefer a unconventional  approach to this business area and we prefer EU products and services.</p>

          <h3>IT Audit &amp Compilance</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The evaluation of an independent third party who has no focused interest in selling products and solutions as a result of the audit is one of the cardinal principles of the service. The auditor's goal is not to replace the customer's suppliers, but to find its vulnerabilities. Conducting an audit before an accident or sanction reduces the damage size.</p>

    <h2>The virtuous path</h2>
    <p>Companies seek IT suppliers with very advanced skills, but the
      competences are crumbled in many partners without an harmonised overview.

    <ul id="paths-list">
      <li><p>Ask your main contractor that sells standardised services a support in
        your customised needs.</p></li>
      <li><p>Ask youy usual supplier a professional service in an area where it has
        no expertise.</p></li>
